### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.
 * 1. Single Page Application: An application that loads one single HTML page and all the dependencies 
      (such as JavaScript and CSS) needed to make the application run. Any interactions with the page(s) don't
      require a another trip to the server and back, meaning that the page doesn't have to be reloaded.

* 2. Compilers: In JavaScript a compiler takes JavaScript code and changes it into a different format.
     ES6 is often transformed into JavaScript of an older syntax for the beneit of older browsers. 

* 3. Bundlers: Bundlers convert JavaScript and CSS written separately in multiple modules into a few files better optimized
     for browsers. Webpack and Browserify are two bundlers commonly used with React.

* 4. Elements: The core building blocks of all React applications. Elements should not be confused with components.
     They describe what you want to see on the screen. React elements aren't normally used directly but are rather returned
     from components.

* 5. Components: React components are small reusable chunks of code that return a React element to be rendered to the webpage.
     The simplest React component is a JavaScript function that returns and element. Components can also be made using ES6 
     classes. React components can return just about anything including other components.

* 6. JSX: JSX is JavaScript in a syntax similar to a template language. It is a syntax extension. JSX is compiled to 
     React.createElement() calls that return JavaScript objects. These objects are also known as React elements.

* 7. Package Managers: Useful tools that let you manage the dependencies in your project. Two good examples of package managers
     are `npm` and `Yarn`.

* 8. CDN: Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached static content from a globe-spanning network of servers.

* 9. Props: Inputs to React components. They are pieces of data that are passed down from parent component to child component.
     `props` are read only and should never be modified in any way. If some value needs to be modified, it should be done with
     `state` instead.
