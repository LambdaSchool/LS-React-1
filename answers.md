### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.

1. Single Page Application

A single page application is a modern way of developing web apps where the app is a single page instead of a number of pages that are each loaded by the server. The single page that is rendered contains all the logic it needs for dynamically updating the page.

2. Compilers

A compiler is what takes our source code and transforms it from one language to another.

3. Bundlers

A bundler is what takes all of our JavaScript and JSX files and wraps them in a single file.

4. Elements

React elements are similar to HTML elements, and are the pieces we use to build components. Unline HTML elements, React elements are immutable.

5. Components

React components are reusable code that return a React element and can contain logic about how that element will render.

6. JSX

JSX allows us to use html-like syntax in with our JavaScript.

7. Package Mangers

Package managers like `npm` allow us to add the packages or modules that we need from the command-line instead of saving and updating the packages manually.

8. CDN

CDNs serve content (such as the React package) that we can consume without manually adding the packages locally.

9. Props and State

Props are how we pass data from a parent component to a child component. State is literally the "state" of our application, and is used to define things that can change in our application.
