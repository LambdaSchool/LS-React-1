9. Props and State
    Props are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component. Props are readonly. To modify some value in response to user input or a network response, use state. A component needs state when some data associated with it changes over time. The most important difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its props, but it can change its state.
