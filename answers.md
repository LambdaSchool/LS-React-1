 * 1. Single Page Application: Loads everything needed for the paget to function at once. No need to re-load the page or get more data from the server in order for the app to work. Once the page loads, everything needed is already there.
 * 2. Compilers: Transforms JavaScript code into a diferent JavaScript format, for example from ES6 into ES5. Compilers are used for browser compatibility.
 * 3. Bundlers: Combine multiple JS and CSS files into one or as fewer as possible, the combined files are better optimized for browsers (Webpack / Browserify).
 * 4. Elements: Building blocks that are used to build react apps.
 * 5. Components: Can be JavaScript functions and classes, they are reusable pieces of code that return React elements to be rendered.
 * 6. JSX: Syntax extension to JavaScript. It gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which returns "React Elements". React DOM uses camelCase, and since in JS class is reserved instead refer to it with className.
 * 7. Package Managers: Handle dependencies in the project(NPM / Yarn).
 * 8. CDN: Content Delivery Network. Deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.
 * 9. Props: Inputs to "React Components", a way to pass data from parent to child components. But they are read-only.
 * 10. State: Is "like a prop that can be changed", components are able to change state using "this.setState()". But only components defined as classes can have states.
