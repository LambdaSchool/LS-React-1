### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.

1. Single Page Application
  An application that loads a single HTML page with everything required to run it (CSS, JavaScript, etc.). 
  The benefit to the user is that he/she can interact with the page without the need to make a round trip to 
  the server--less need to reload the page.

2. Compilers
   In CS the word compiler can mean many things but in this case a JavaScript compiler--such as Babel--takes
   JavaScript code of one type and turns it into JavaScript code of another type. The most common use for this
   is to transform newer JavaScript into JavaScript of an older syntax that an older browser can understand.

3. Bundlers
  Bundlers take a bunch of JavaScript and CSS code written as separate files and bundles them into fewer files
  so they work better with browsers. Two great examples of bundlers are Webpack and Browserify.

4. Elements
  The building blocks of all React applications. Should not be confused with React components. An element 
  describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are immutable. Elements are normally not used directly, but are instead returned from React components.

5. Components
  React components are little reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page.
