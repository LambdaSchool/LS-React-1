 * 1. A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded.
 <!--***** Single Page Application *****-->
 * 1. A single-page application has everything that it needs for it to run on its HTML. It interacts and links itself with other necessary assets that it can use.

 * 2. A JavaScript compiler takes JavaScript code, transforms it and returns JavaScript code in a different format. The most common use case is to take ES6 syntax and transform it into syntax that older browsers are capable of interpreting.
 <!-- ***** Compilers ***** -->
 
 * 3. Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules (often hundreds of them), and combine them together into a few files better optimized for the browsers.

 * 4. React elements are the building blocks of React applications. One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are immutable.
 <!-- ***** Elements ***** -->

 * 5. React components are small, resuable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page.Components can be broken down into distinct pieces of functionality and used within other components. Components can return other components, arrays, strings and numbers.
 <!-- ***** Components ***** -->

 * 6. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”. 
 <!-- ***** JSX ***** -->

 * 7. Package managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project. npm and Yarn are two package managers commonly used in React applications.
 <!-- ***** Package Managers ***** -->

 * 8. CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.
 <!-- ***** CDN ***** -->

 * 9. props are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component. Remember that props are readonly. They should not be modified in any way.
 <!-- ***** Props ***** -->

 * 10. A component needs state when some data associated with it changes over time. The most important difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its props, but it can change its state.
