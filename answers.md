### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.

Describe the following, Single Page Application, Compilers, Bundlers, Elements, Components, JSX, Package Mangers, CDN, Props and State.

 1. Single Page Application 
 A Single Page Application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets required for it to run. It updates the HTML as the user interacts with it.

 2. Compilers
 Compilers transform JS code into a different format that browsers can interpret.

 3. Bundlers
 Bundlers take JS and CSS written as separate modules and combine them into just a few files for optimization.

 4. Elements
 Elements are immutable and describe what you want to see on the screen.

 5. Components
 Components are small, reusable pieces of code that return an Element to be rendered. Components are essentially a JavaScript Function.

 6. JSX
 JavaScript Syntax Extension;

 7. Package Managers
 Package managers allow you to update and install dependencies on your computer. Npm and yarn are package managers.

 8. CDN
 A CDN (Content Delivery Network) stores a cached version of a web content in many places around the world to allow faster access for people near that area. For example, if the content is based in Canada and someone in Australia wanted to access it, there would be a cached version somewhere in Australia.

 9. Props
 Props allow us to continuously monitor state.
 Arguments passed to components are called Props. They look similar to element attributes.

 10. State
 State allows you to dynamically change many elements at once based on one variable. 
 The State is a JavaScript object that lives inside each component. We can access it via this.state. Everything is contingent upon changes in state. When the state of a parent component changes, the child components automatically inherit the new state.
 Every component can have its own state.
