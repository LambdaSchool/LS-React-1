 * 1. Describe the following, Single Page Application, Compilers, Bundlers, Elements, Components, JSX, Package Mangers, CDN, Props and State. 
 
   1. A single Page application is an application that loads a single HTML page, JavaScript and CSS that are required for the page to be run at the same time.
	    The application is set up so that all user interactions happen without the need the page to be reloaded.
	
	 2. A compiler takes JavaScript code, transforms it and returns JavaScript code in a different format.
	    An example of a compiler is Babel which is most commonly used with React.

	 3. A bundler takes JavaScript and CSS code written separately and combines it to make more files better optimized for browsers. 
	    Two examples of bundlers that work with React are Webpack and Browserify.

   4. Elements are the building blocks of React applications. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. 
	    Elements are immutable and get returned from components rather than directly.

	 5. Components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. 
	    They can be broken down into distinct pieces of functionality and used within other components. 
			They can return other components, arrays, strings and numbers.

	 6. JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language. 

	 7. Package Managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project that we need such as npm.

	 8. CDN or Content Delivery Network deliver cached, static content from a network of servers.

	 9. Props are readonly data passed down from a parent to child components.

	 10. States are different from props in one important way they are managed by the component itself and are 
	     modifiable through the command (this.setState()). Props must be passed from a parent component.
