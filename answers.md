### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.

1.  Single Page Application
    \*A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets required for the application to run, ensuring that the page is not reloaded.

2.  Compilers
    \*A Compiler takes code, transforms it and returns code in a different format.

3.  Bundlers
    \*Bundlers take separate JavaScript and CSS modules, and combine them together into a few files that are optimized for the browsers.

4.  Elements
    \*React elements are the building blocks of React applications. Not to be confused with the concept of “components”. An element describes what you want to see on the screen and are immutable.

5.  Components
    \*React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page.

6.  JSX
    \*JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”.

7.  Package Mangers
    \*Package managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project. npm and Yarn are two package managers commonly used in React applications. Both of them are clients for the same npm package registry.

8.  CDN
    \*CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.

9.  Props and State
    *Props are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.
    *A component needs state when some data associated with it changes over time. For example, a Checkbox component might need isChecked in its state, and a NewsFeed component might want to keep track of fetchedPosts in its state. The most important difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its props, but it can change its state. To do so, it must call this.setState(). Only components defined as classes can have state.
