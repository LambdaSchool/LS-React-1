 1. Single Page Application- A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) needed for the application to run.
 2. Compilers- A JavaScript compiler takes JavaScript code, and returns it in a different format. An example is ES6 syntax being transformed into syntax that older browsers can understand. The compiler most commonly used with React is called Babel.
 3. Bundlers- Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules, and combine them together into a few files, making them better optimized for the browsers.
