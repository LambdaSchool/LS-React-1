Describe the following, Single Page Application, Compilers, Bundlers, Elements, Components, JSX, Package Mangers, CDN, Props and State.

#Single Page Application
A Single Page Application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets required for it to run.

#Compilers
Compilers transform JS code into a different format that browsers can interpret.

#Bundlers
Bundlers take JS and CSS written as separate modules and combine them into just a few files for optimization.

#Elements
Elements are immutable and describe what you want to see on the screen.

#Components
Components are small, reusable pieces of code that return an Element to be rendered. Components are essentially a JavaScript Function.

#JSX
JavaScript Syntax Extension.

#Package Managers
Package Managers are software that automate downloading, installing, configuring, or removing programs.

#CDN
A CDN is a Content Distribution Network.

#Props
Props allow us to continuously monitor state. Arguments passed to components are called Props. They look similar to element attributes.

#State
State allows you to dynamically change many elements at once based on one variable.
The State is a JavaScript object that lives inside each component. We can access it via this.state. Everything is contingent upon changes in state. When the state of a parent component changes, the child components automatically inherit the new state.
Every component can have its own state.
