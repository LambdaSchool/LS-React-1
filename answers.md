 * 1. Single Page Application -> loads single page HTML with all necessary assets so it does not need to recontact the server (client side only updates)


 2. Compilers -> takes JS code & transforms it in a different format (commonly transforming ES6 into format older browsers can utilize); ex: Babel for React


 3. Bundlers -> takes modules of JS & CSS and combines them down into a few files (optimizing for browsers); ex: Webpack & Browserify for React


 4. Elements -> immutable; building blocks of React; not typically used directly but returned from components


 5. Components -> reusable pieces of code that return element to be rendered; simplest version of this is a plain JS function returning a React element


 6. JSX -> syntax extension to JS (full capabilities of JS); gets compiled to React.createElement() which returns plain JS objects (React elements)


 7. Package Mangers -> tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your projects


 8. CDN -> deliver static content from network of servers worldwide
