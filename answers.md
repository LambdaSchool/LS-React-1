Single Page Application:
	A single page application uses a single load of all page assets. Once loaded the page is independent of the server housing the site. All user interaction is completed within the local state of the page and does not require any refreshing or updating of data from the server.

Compilers
	JavaScript compilers are used to convert JavaScript code into different formats. Due to the dynamic nature of code, new versions of existing frameworks are released faster than browsers and users can keep up. To combat this compilers are used to convert code into syntax that is compatible with legacy browsers.

Bundlers
	Bundlers are used to consolidate many pages of JavaScript and CSS into a format that is easier for browsers to interpret; this allows for browser optimization. 

Package Managers
    Package Manager is that it is a tool that helps manage dependencies (pieces of software(code) that points to and relies on another piece of software) within the project

CDN
	Content Delivery Network or CDN; are cached content that is stored on servers globally. Programmers are able to pull from these networks to assist in the building of applications.

JSX
	JSX is an extension of JavaScript; it uses varying syntax to achieve similar results; it leverages JavaScript in a format that is a little easier to interpret in regards to how a UI should appear.
JSX uses a special React.createElement() to compile JSX into plain JavaScript for borwser support and to support bug free code. 


Elements
	The building block of React application; they are immutable descriptions of expected screen output; they are not components, but rather returned from components. Elements are typically not used directly.

Components
	Components are individual pieces of fully functional code that can be reused and recycled to support consistent web page displays, and  can vastly improve speed of application development. Components must return a React element to be rendered on a page.

Props
	Readonly (should not be modified) inputs to a React component; information passed down from a parent to a child.

State
	State is a instance of data or input that is stored in memory and updated after some changes were made to the existing state.
	States are managed internally by the component; while props are passed from a parent component.  Only classes can have states. (this.state)
